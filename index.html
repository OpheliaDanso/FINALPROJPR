                Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the
                Gulf of Guinea. Although relatively small in area and
                population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa,
                partly because of its considerable natural wealth and partly
                because it was the first black African country south of the
                Sahara to achieve independence from colonial rule. In addition
                to being known for its lush forests, diverse animal life, and
                miles of sandy beaches along a picturesque coast, Ghana is also
                celebrated for its rich history—its habitation possibly dating
                from 10,000 BCE—and as a fascinating repository of cultural
                heritage. The country takes it name from the great medieval
                trading empire that was located northwest of the modern-day
                state until its demise in the 13th century. Direct sea trade
                with Europe, established in the 15th century, had much impact on
                the area’s inhabitants, many of whom actively traded with the
                Portuguese, Dutch, British, and other Europeans. Forts and
                castles, many of which still dot the Ghanaian coast today, were
                constructed by Europeans to protect their trade interests.
                Although trading was originally centred on the gold that was
                readily available in the area (and from which the future British
                colony the Gold Coast would take its name), the focus shifted to
                the lucrative slave trade in the 17th century. The area later
                became known for growing cacao, the source of cocoa beans.
                Introduced there in the late 19th century, cacao continues to
                provide an important export for Ghana.
              </p>
              <p>
                Modern-day Ghana, which gained its independence on March 6,
                1957, consists primarily of the former Gold Coast. The colony’s
                drive for independence was led by nationalist and Pan-African
                leader Kwame Nkrumah, who viewed Ghana’s sovereignty as being
                important not only for the Ghanaian people but for all of
                Africa, saying “Our independence is meaningless unless it is
                linked up with the total liberation of the African continent.”
                Indeed, more than 30 other African countries, spurred by Ghana’s
                example, followed suit and declared their own independence
                within the next decade.

                clothings makes it magical. Yes indeed we are the land of gold
                and that is why we adore ourselves in the best of pure radiance,
                which purifies our skin and our beauty. We dance richly and
                harmoniously to thank God fro all that we have been blessed with
                and all that we have. With a rhythm from our drums and the sun
                rays glowing in our presence, we entertain ourselves with music
                and story tellings, laughter and hand shakes to welcome
                ourselves into the atmosphere of love and peace.

                Ghana has a rich indigenous culture. Culturally, the peoples of
                Ghana have many affinities with their French-speaking
                neighbours, but each ethnic group has distinctive cultural
                attributes. In all parts of the country the cultural heritage is
                closely linked with religion and the institution of chieftaincy.
                Various festivals and rites are centred on chieftaincy and the
                family and are occasioned by such events as harvest, marriage,
                birth, puberty, and death.
                <br />
                Ghanaian society is without sharp class distinctions. Insofar as
                traditional authority is based on a system of hereditary
                chieftaincy, it is possible to speak of aristocratic classes
                within the ethnic groups, but the institution of chieftaincy is
                essentially democratic in operation, and the authority of chiefs
                is broadly based. Land is usually owned by families, militating
                against the emergence of a small, powerful landed class wielding
                economic control over a landless class. These inherent
                egalitarian tendencies of the society have been heightened by
                economic and social mobility, depending on education and
                individual enterprise.

                Ghanaian food is diverse. It is a product of its climate, its
                history and its people. Simply put, Ghanaian food consists of a
                lot of spicy soups and stews made with a lot of tomatoes,
                onions, pepper, ginger and a variety of indigenous spices. Stews
                are thick and are usually accompanied with starchy tubers like
                the West African yam, or plantains. Soups are light and
                accompanied with a variety of starchy swallows made from tubers
                like cassava, cocoyam or West African yam, plantains or corn. If
                we are not eating a swallow or starchy tuber, we are eating
                rice. Plain rice, jollof rice, waakye, agwa mu, fried rice, the
                list goes on and on.

                Ghana has a wealth of things to see and do. For the seasoned
                traveller not content with just visiting the numerous tourist
                sites in the country, there are a number of memorable
                experiences to be undertaken that are guaranteed to leave an
                indelible mark and be the topic of conversation long after you
                have left
                <br />
                The coastal communities of the Western, Central, Greater Accra
                and Volta Regions are well known for their fishing activities
                and provide an opportunity for visitors to join in on a day’s
                fishing experience. A day’s fishing experience with local
                fishermen includes pushing out and rowing the long hand built
                canoes, casting out nets, rowing canoes back to shore and
                joining a large number of people to manually pull the nets back
                to shore with lots of singing and cheering. It is an exciting
                experience that occurs on a daily basis, except on Tuesdays, in
                some areas, when fishing is prohibited.

                The dry savannah of the Northern Regions with its sparse
                populace and predominately rural nature is perfect for the
                adventurer who really wants to get off the beaten track.
                Visitors can enjoy hiking or mountain biking from village to
                village and also experience village life by taking the
                opportunity to spend a few weeks with villagers learning how to
                cook, weave and hunt.
                <br />
                The Western Region is also known as the surfing capital of
                Ghana, during low tides the wave are gentle but steady and
                however long, during the high tide that promises numerous great
                rides for advanced riders. Busua Beach is the popular location
                for surfers of all levels from across the country. Ankrobra
                Beach Resort, which also gives first lessons has recently
                started a tutoring programme for local youngsters with the
                intention of raising the profile of the sport with relatively
                low participation costs.

                The Kwahu Mountain Range in the Eastern Region is known for its
                annual Easter Paragliding event when a host of internationally
                renowned gliders show off their skills, compete and give locals
                and visitors an opportunity to try out the sport. Also in the
                Eastern Region is a unique opportunity to take to the skies in
                single engine ultralights provided by WAASPS. This flying centre
                operating from Kpong Airfield, offers the opportunity for those
